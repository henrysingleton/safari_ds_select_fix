Safari DS Select Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 1.0

Build Date: 2011-10-11
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.1 or greater

This extension fixes a minor bug in Safari, where items in a multi-select
select box disappear if they are filtered via JavaScript. It does this by 
triggering Safari to repaint the select box by modifying the 'size'
attribute.
